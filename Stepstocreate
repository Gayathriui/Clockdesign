Create a circle to represent the clock face.
Draw hour marks and labels around the clock face (1-12).
Draw hands for hours, minutes, and seconds that move in real time or can be manually updated.
Add divisions for the minute marks between the numbers.
Update the clock hands to show the current time (optional, requires time library).
